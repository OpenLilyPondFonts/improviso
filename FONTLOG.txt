FONTLOG for the Improviso font
==============================

This file provides detailed information on the Improviso Font Software. This information should be distributed along with the Improviso fonts and any derivative works.


Basic font information
----------------------
Improviso is a typeface designed by Abraham Lee to resemble the style of traditional hand copyists. This font software is not designed for use in a word-processing application, although all the glyphs may be accessed at their respective Unicode points. It was originally designed for use with GNU LilyPond, the automatic music engraver.
